Let's break down what that means.\n",

The better a model performs, the higher its likelihood will be, with a perfect model having a likelihood of 1 (meaning it predicted 100% probability for each correct label).\n",
    "- Log Likelihood: Likelihood values can become extremely small when multiplying many probabilities, which is hard for computers to work with due to limited precision. Taking the log solves this, because $log(a*b*c) == log(a) + log(b) + log(c)$. This replaces multiplication with addition, which is more numerically stable. Since the log function is monotonically increasing, maximizing the log likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.\n",

    "First, we calculated the logits with `c_enc @ W`, which multiplied our one-hot encoded vector `c_enc` (which represents \"c\" as a 1 at index 3 and 0 elsewhere) by the weights matrix `W`. As discussed earlier, multiplying a one-hot vector by a matrix selects the corresponding row of the matrix, which in this case is row 3, and multiplies each other row by 0. This means that only the weights in row 3 of `W` can have any effect on the loss. Changing the other weights can't impact the loss, since any change would still end up getting multiplied by 0.\n",

    "As a result, when we look at the gradient, we should expect the partial derivatives to be zero everywhere except for the weights in row 3.\n",

We don't want that, since we're trying to minimize the loss. The only weight that has a negative partial derivative with respect to loss (meaning increasing it will decrease the loss) is the weight at index 1. This should make sense, as in this demonstration we specifically were trying to find the probability of the model predicting \"a\", which would be found at index 1 of the row selected by \"c\".
