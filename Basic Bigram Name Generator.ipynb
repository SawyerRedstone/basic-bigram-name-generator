Let's break down what that means.\n",

The better a model performs, the higher its likelihood will be, with a perfect model having a likelihood of 1 (meaning it predicted 100% probability for each correct label).\n",
    "- Log Likelihood: Likelihood values can become extremely small when multiplying many probabilities, which is hard for computers to work with due to limited precision. Taking the log solves this, because $log(a*b*c) == log(a) + log(b) + log(c)$. This replaces multiplication with addition, which is more numerically stable. Since the log function is monotonically increasing, maximizing the log likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.\n",

    "First, we calculated the logits with `c_enc @ W`, which multiplied our one-hot encoded vector `c_enc` (which represents \"c\" as a 1 at index 3 and 0 elsewhere) by the weights matrix `W`. As discussed earlier, multiplying a one-hot vector by a matrix selects the corresponding row of the matrix, which in this case is row 3, and multiplies each other row by 0. This means that only the weights in row 3 of `W` can have any effect on the loss. Changing the other weights can't impact the loss, since any change would still end up getting multiplied by 0.\n",

    "As a result, when we look at the gradient, we should expect the partial derivatives to be zero everywhere except for the weights in row 3.\n",

    "From this chart, we can notice two things. Firstly, the blue line appears to be fluxuating a lot. This makes sense, as using mini-batches as small as we used means that often the correct label in one batch will be incorrect in the next batch, causing a higher loss. The second thing we can see from this chart is that it actually appears that our previous learning rate of 0.1 wasn't too high at all. What we were seeing before must have been due to all the fluxuations between batches. Here we can see that the loss on a whole doesn't seem to rise until the learning rate reaches above 14. Now that we've seen the results of different learning rates, let's try training our model with a learning rate of 14.\n",

    "Since we are using very small mini batches, the loss fluxuates a lot, as it's common that one batch would contain labels that are different from the previous one. This is why the blue line in the graph is so thick -- it jumps up and down a lot between batches. However, looking at this graph, it doesn't seem like any of these rates are too high. A high learning rate would cause the loss to rise back up, but although it jumps around between batches, the loss on a whole never noticeably seems to climb back up. This may be a result of the simplicity of our model. We didn't add anything to make the model non-linear, so there is less to cause the loss to bounce around. -->"
