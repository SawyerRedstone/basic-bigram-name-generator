    "The goal of this project is to create a simple language model that can generate names resembling real ones from its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a neural network trained on character-level bigrams -- that is, pairs of consecutive letters. When the model is given a letter as input, it should predict the probability of each possible next letter. We can then use these probabilities to pick the next letter in a name, then feed that new letter back into the model to continue generating the name, one letter at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- There will be two main steps for completing this goal. First, we'll train the model so it learns common bigrams in names. Next, we'll use that trained model to generate new, never-seen-before names. -->\n",
